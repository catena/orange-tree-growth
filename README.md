# Orange Tree Growth Estimator


## Overview and Usage

This shiny application can be used to estimate the growth of an orange tree. It uses the Orange dataset and fits a non linear least squares model to estimate the tree growth. Please note this is an experimental tool and may not be accurate.  

Use the slider to select the age of the orange tree. The estimated tree height will be displayed instantly. The tree height is reported as circumference at breast height, which is a standard measurement in forestry.  

To see it in live, see [this][1] rpubs link.  


Note: **Requires** shiny 0.12.2 and plotly 1.0.3.

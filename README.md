# Orange Tree Growth Estimator


## Overview and Usage

This shiny application can be used to estimate the growth of an orange tree. It uses the Orange dataset in R (part of `nlme` package) and fits a non linear least squares model to estimate the tree growth. Please note this is an experimental tool and may not be accurate.  

Use the slider to select the age of the orange tree. The estimated tree height will be displayed instantly. The tree height is reported as circumference at breast height in mm, which is a standard measurement in forestry.
